SETUP:
- The GroupDatabase zip file contains the postgresql installation files in order to install and test if needed. 
- This database must be installed in the same manner as the Database that we installed for Assignment 0 in class. Then, you must make sure that the server is started and running.
- Then, all files must be downloaded and all npm dependecies MUST be installed in order for this to work.
- RECCOMEND USING VSCODE FOR THE SETUP OF THIS APPLICATION ON YOUR COMPUTER.
- Inside of our Backend folder, .js files must be modified with the User's own local server connection settings. (hostname, etc.)
- Then, the node.js server for the fetch calls also must be running on the User's computer in order for the application to able o make fetch calls using the API. (Navigate into the API folder, and npm install, , npm init -y, npm install express, npm install pg, then start the server by running node app.js).
- After you have done this, navigate into the projectsource folder of the files.
- Then, run npm install node-fetch, and then do npm start.
- This should open the Web Application in a browser on your computer. Then, follow the user manual in the Report submitted on canvas in order to runt he application the way you want and test it out!
